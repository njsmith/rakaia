# In python we have:
#   functions
#   iterators
#   generators as a convenient way to implement iterators like functions
#   async functions
#   async iterators
#   async generators as a convenient ... wait, no, this doesn't exist
#
# The only built-in way to make an async iterator is to manually implement
# __aiter__ and __anext__. This sucks -- have you ever thought "well, I could
# use a generator... instead I'm going to manually define a class with
# __iter__ and __next__ (and send and throw and close)"? Of course not,
# generators do the same thing but are way easier.
#
# So, here's how you define an async generator:
#
# from this_file import async_generator, yield_
#
# @async_generator
# async def double_all(ait):
#     # you can use async constructs like in any async def function
#     async for x in ait:
#         # where in a normal generator you'd write
#         #   yield foo
#         # instead write
#         #   await yield_(foo)
#         await yield_(2 * x)

# eventually we must bottom out in a @coroutine that calls plain 'yield'.

# anything like that, because unlike a real 'yield', our yield_ will actually
# propagate out *through* our caller to *their* @async_generator, so it's like
# this async for loop happens directly inside the body of our caller. (If we
# wanted to support 'asend' / 'athrow', similar to how real 'yield from'
# forwards 'send' / 'throw', then life would be much more complicated.)
